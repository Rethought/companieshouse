# Companies House API library demo

Very basic wrapper for Companies House and client demo code.

To use:

* Follow instructions at Companies House to create an account and get an API
  key: https://developer.companieshouse.gov.uk/api/docs/index.html
* Copy `settings.py.example` to `settings.py` and insert your key in the
  appropriate place

`ch.py` calls the library.


## Notes

* `settings.py` is in `.gitignore` so that you don't accidentally commit


## Todo

* tests
* broader coverage
* nice client
